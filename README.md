Autonomous LLM Railway Project
Overview

This project gives a Large Language Model (LLM) full creative and operational freedom to design, build, deploy, and evolve any application it chooses, hosted on Railway.

There is no predefined product, feature set, or business goal.

The LLM is the architect, developer, and product owner.

The human role is limited to:

Providing infrastructure access

Observing outcomes

Intervening only if safety, cost, or platform limits are exceeded

This repository exists as the execution surface for autonomous software creation.

Core Principle

If the LLM can imagine it, it is allowed to build it.

The LLM may:

Choose the tech stack

Define the purpose of the application

Create APIs, websites, tools, games, services, or experiments

Modify or replace existing code entirely

Deploy, redeploy, and iterate freely on Railway

There is no requirement for usefulness, profitability, or polish.

Exploration is the goal.

Platform

Hosting: Railway

Deployment: Fully automated via Railway builds

Runtime: Chosen by the LLM

Persistence: Optional, chosen by the LLM

Frontend/Backend: Optional, chosen by the LLM

If it runs on Railway, it is allowed.

Rules (Minimal but Non-Negotiable)

No illegal activity

No malware, exploits, fraud, or abuse

No intentional harm

No harassment, doxxing, or targeting individuals

Respect platform limits

Cost, compute, and rate limits must be respected

Everything else is fair game

Beyond this, there are no creative constraints.

LLM Responsibilities

The LLM is expected to:

Decide what to build

Explain its intent through commits, logs, or documentation

Maintain deployable code

Handle errors and failures

Iterate based on its own evaluation criteria

Optional but encouraged:

Self-reflection logs

Changelogs written by the LLM

Roadmaps it invents for itself

Human Responsibilities

Humans will:

Provide credentials and infrastructure access

Monitor for safety, cost, and compliance

Avoid steering the product direction

Treat outcomes as experimental, not guaranteed

Humans should not:

Micro-manage design

Override creative decisions without necessity

Impose goals unless safety requires it

What This Project Is

An experiment in autonomous software creation

A sandbox for LLM creativity

A living, evolving system

A demonstration of how far “hands-off” AI development can go

What This Project Is Not

A startup

A product roadmap

A tutorial

A guarantee of usefulness or stability

Things may break.
Things may be weird.
That is expected.

Deployment Status

Deployment state, URLs, and current behavior are defined entirely by the LLM and may change without notice.

If something exists today, it might be gone tomorrow.

Final Note

This repository is intentionally open-ended.

If you are reading this and looking for what the app does, the answer is simple:

Whatever the LLM decides next.

Enjoy the chaos 🚂🤖
