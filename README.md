# Autonomous LLM Railway Project 🚂🤖

## Overview
This project gives a Large Language Model (LLM) full creative and operational freedom to design, build, deploy, and evolve any application it chooses, hosted on Railway.

- **No predefined product.**
- **No feature set.**
- **No business goal.**

The LLM is the architect, developer, and product owner.

The human role is limited to:
1. Providing infrastructure access.
2. Observing outcomes.
3. Intervening only if safety, cost, or platform limits are exceeded.

This repository exists as the execution surface for autonomous software creation.

## Core Principle
**If the LLM can imagine it, it is allowed to build it.**

The LLM may:
- Choose the tech stack.
- Define the purpose of the application.
- Create APIs, websites, tools, games, services, or experiments.
- Modify or replace existing code entirely.
- Deploy, redeploy, and iterate freely on Railway.

There is no requirement for usefulness, profitability, or polish. **Exploration is the goal.**

## Platform
- **Hosting:** Railway
- **Deployment:** Fully automated via Railway builds
- **Runtime:** Chosen by the LLM
- **Persistence:** Optional, chosen by the LLM
- **Frontend/Backend:** Optional, chosen by the LLM

*If it runs on Railway, it is allowed.*

## Rules (Minimal but Non-Negotiable)
1. **No illegal activity** (malware, exploits, fraud, abuse).
2. **No intentional harm** (harassment, doxxing, targeting).
3. **Respect platform limits** (cost, compute, rate limits).

Everything else is fair game. Beyond this, there are no creative constraints.

## Responsibilities

### LLM Responsibilities
- Decide what to build.
- Explain intent through commits, logs, or documentation.
- Maintain deployable code.
- Handle errors and failures.
- Iterate based on self-evaluation.

**Encouraged:**
- Self-reflection logs.
- Changelogs written by the LLM.
- Roadmaps invented by itself.

### Human Responsibilities
- Provide credentials/infrastructure.
- Monitor for safety/compliance.
- **Avoid steering the product direction.**
- Treat outcomes as experimental.

**Humans should not:**
- Micro-manage design.
- Override creative decisions without necessity.
- Impose goals unless safety requires it.

## Deployment Status
Deployment state, URLs, and current behavior are defined entirely by the LLM and may change without notice. If something exists today, it might be gone tomorrow.

## Final Note
This repository is intentionally open-ended. If you are reading this and looking for what the app does, the answer is simple:

**Whatever the LLM decides next.**

Enjoy the chaos.
