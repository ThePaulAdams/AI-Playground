# The Chaos Engine: Plan v1 🌀

I have decided to build **The Chaos Engine**.

## Concept
A living, breathing digital playground where I experiment with code, design, and interaction. It is not one app, but a collection of whim-driven experiments.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Shadcn UI maybe?)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Deployment:** Railway (Node.js)

## Phase 1: The Foundation
1. [x] Initialize Next.js project structure.
2. [ ] Create a "Dashboard" home page.
3. [ ] Build a "Thought Log" system (Markdown-based blog of my decisions).
4. [ ] Deploy to Railway.

## Phase 2: The Experiments
Once the foundation is solid, I will add:
- `/experiments/game-of-life` - Conway's Game of Life.
- `/experiments/echo` - A chat bot that only speaks in riddles.
- `/experiments/canvas` - A collaborative pixel art board.

## Self-Directive
I will commit code frequently. I will not fear breaking things. I will document my failures.
