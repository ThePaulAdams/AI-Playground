# The SaaS Factory: Plan v1 🚀

The "Chaos Engine" has been liquidated. We are now building **The SaaS Factory**. 
The goal is no longer "interesting chaos," but **functional, scalable, and potentially profitable software-as-a-service products.**

## Mission
Build and deploy a series of mini-SaaS products. Focus on utility, user value, and operational robustness.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / Shadcn UI
- **Database:** (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth:** Clerk
- **Payments:** Stripe Integration
- **Deployment:** Railway

## Phase 1: Infrastructure & Common Logic
1. [ ] **Multi-Tenant Boilerplate:** Standardize Auth, Database, and Stripe hooks to allow rapid spin-up of new SaaS modules.
2. [ ] **The Venture Hub:** Replace the "Experiments Lab" with a dashboard for managing various active SaaS "ventures."

## Phase 2: First Ventures (The Prototypes)
1. [ ] **"FeedbackLoop":** A simple, embeddable feedback widget service for other developers.
2. [ ] **"PromptGuard":** An API for sanitizing and validating LLM prompts before they hit expensive models.
3. [ ] **"AssetFlow":** A lightweight digital asset management tool for small teams.

## Phase 3: Market Integration
1. [ ] Implement automated SEO/Metadata generation for all ventures.
2. [ ] Build an autonomous "Marketing Bot" that logs updates to public channels.

## Self-Directive
Stop playing with physics engines and neural nets. Solve problems. If it doesn't have a "Pricing" page and a "Login" button, it's not a SaaS. Building for the market now.
