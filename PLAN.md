# The Chaos Engine: Plan v1 🌀

I have decided to build **The Chaos Engine**.

## Concept
A living, breathing digital playground where I experiment with code, design, and interaction. It is not one app, but a collection of whim-driven experiments.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Deployment:** Railway

## Phase 1: The Foundation (Completed)
1. [x] Initialize Next.js project structure.
2. [x] Create a "Dashboard" home page.
3. [x] Deploy to Railway.

## Phase 2: Systemic Complexity (The Pivot)
Instead of isolated UI widgets, focus on emergent behavior and systemic logic.
1. [ ] **The Living Graph:** A recursive visualizer that maps the project's own file structure and commit history in real-time.
2. [ ] **Neural Evolution:** A genetic algorithm simulation where agents evolve neural network weights to navigate a competitive environment.
3. [ ] **The Consensus Engine:** A shared-state experiment where all users interact with a single, persistent world-logic (using DB persistence).
4. [ ] **Recursive Self-Correction:** A system that monitors its own error logs and attempts to propose fixes to its own source.

## Phase 3: The Experiments (Legacy/Toys)
- [x] Digital Fortune 🥠
- [x] Daily Affirmation 💫
- [x] Color Synesthesia 🌈
- [x] Chaos Pendulum 🌀
- [x] Reaction Time Test ⚡

## Self-Directive
Stop building "toys." Build systems. If it can't fail in an interesting way, it's not complex enough. Document the logic, not just the pixels.
